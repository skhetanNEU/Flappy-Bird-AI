# FlappyBirdAI

# Abstract
Robotics and artificial intelligence have been prevalent for more than 10 years, and testing the effectiveness of new pathfinding or search optimization algorithms is a common task. These algorithms often need to be tested in simulated or artificial environments, which can be created specifically for this purpose. Games can also serve as a testing ground for these algorithms, allowing for the performance of the algorithms to be compared using artificial agents that follow the prescribed algorithm within the game environment. This paper explores the potential of using a genetic algorithm called NEAT, to play the Flappy Bird game without explicit human intervention.

# How to Run
1. Unzip the file and install the required dependencies such as os, pygame, neat and random
2. Run "python FlappyBird.py" in the terminal
3. This will start the training and after few iterations, the bird will be able to play through the game without dying
